            <strong>Yangon, Myanmar</strong>
            <p>In the run-up to Myanmar’s historic 2015 election, the Foundation and local partners worked together to create the only consistently available and reliable source of candidate information: the <a href="http://maepaysoh.org">Mae Pay Soh (“Let’s Vote”)</a> voter information database. The database and its related application programming interface (API), gave software developers direct access to a suite of official information collected and verified by the Myanmar Union Election Commission, including official data on the nearly 6000 candidates and 90+ political parties contesting the election.</p>
            <p>This resource proved invaluable to the country’s emerging civic tech community, especially during the groundbreaking “Mae Pay Soh Hack Challenge,” a two-week programming competition organized by The Asia Foundation to create election-related mobile and web applications. More than 130 developers and designers in 30 teams entered the competition and 31 different web and mobile applications were submitted to the judges, making it Myanmar’s largest programming competition to date. Ten of the most polished applications were made available for free online and in the Google Play and iOS app stores, where they have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times already.</p>

            <strong>New Delhi, India</strong>
            <p>Emerging from the local women’s movement against street harassment, bullying and stalking, new social collaboration tools like <a href="http://safetipin.org">SafetiPin</a> are helping women work together to assess the relative safety of urban areas in India’s largest cities.  Free to download, SafetiPin is an Android and iOS app that employs location services and an open-source map to allow users to rate a neighborhood or a specific street’s relative safety, while also showing how others have rated that area.</p>
            <p>At the core of the app is the Safety Audit. Users rate the safety of a given area based on key parameters such as the availability of working street lights, the presence of police and other security personnel, the number of men or women on the street, and the overall mood on the street.  The Asia Foundation worked with SafetiPin to provide professionally trained auditors to collect additional safety-related information on communities and cities to augment data submitted by users.</p>
            <p>SafetiPin builds on the premise that community participation and engagement will make India’s cities safer. By leveraging India’s over 300 million mobile phone subscribers, this initiative is transforming the way women connect with one another and obtain safety and security information from within their local communities.</p>

            <strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>
            <p>While access to timely, accurate, and official information during natural disasters is a major concern of citizens and governments across Asia, <i>coordination</i> and <i>dissemination</i> of this information has proven challenging. A case in point is the 2011 Bangkok flood: at the height of the disaster, residents and visitors alike were faced with confusing and conflicting announcements from various government ministries. Thais then turned to the Internet and social media to obtain more relevant information and advice. In the aftermath of the flood, the government acknowledged the need for better coordination on DRM data sharing, and disaster preparedness in general.</p>
            <p>The Asia Foundation is working with the National Disaster Warning Center and the Department of Disaster Mitigation and Prevention to expand the use of public APIs to enhance access to government DRM data and better integrate with existing social media platforms popular with Thais. The project will make it possible for disaster response agencies in Thailand to deliver real-time alerts to citizens via social media and better coordinate response efforts with government partners.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Foundation has helped form a DRM Data Working Group to conduct research, initiate pilot projects, and facilitate greater collaboration on DRM data sharing initiatives among key stakeholders. An emerging community of DRM data partners in Thailand - including Thai entrepreneurs, software developers, civic tech experts, and reform-minded government officials - have joined this initiative, and regular meetings are taking place to facilitate problem-solving and coordination across agencies, and pilot simple data sharing and analysis technologies that have potential to help DRM agencies better protect property and save lives.</p>

            <strong>Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia</strong>
            <p>Three quarters of a million nomads from across Mongolia now inhabit the “Ger Areas” – a ring of unplanned communities and low-income neighborhoods surrounding the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. In the next decade these areas are expected to grow by an estimated 400,000 additional residents, making the Ger Areas of Ulaanbaatar one of the largest unplanned settlements in Asia.</p>
            <p>A key challenge facing the city government as it struggles to provide water, education, transportation, and other basic urban services to the Ger Areas is a shortage of good data. Current maps of Ulaanbaatar do not represent the existing Ger Areas in much detail. Satellite imagery accessible to the city is often of a low resolution or obscured by cloud cover. Without good geospatial data, planning for the delivery of basic services is very difficult.</p>
            <p>Working with the City of Ulaanbaatar, The Asia Foundation is collecting high-quality imagery and elevation data for the city using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and earth-imaging satellites. These high-resolution images are used to create detailed maps complete with elevation data, and labeled neighborhoods, roads, buildings, landmarks, and other features. And in a bid to make this information open and accessible to all, the maps were shared with <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap (OSM)</a>, a world-wide, community-driven mapping project.</p>

            <p>In Nepal, thousands of young people depart Kathmandu every day on flights to the Gulf Countries and Malaysia, where they make do with limited resources, squalid conditions, and the little knowledge they can glean from Internet and social media sources available on their mobile phones. The Asia Foundation's Safe Migration App, called <i>Shuvayatra</i> ("Safe Travels"), offers access to Nepali networks and multimedia content that can help migrants prepare for the experience in host countries both before and during their time abroad.</p>
            <p>Through the app, users can find relevant, local-language content developed specifically for Nepali migrants, including extensive written materials, a news feed, audio clips and podcasts, and answers to common questions. Migrants can also use the app’s social media features to share information online.</p>
            <p>We’ve put years of research into the needs of Nepali migrant workers and partnered with some of the most experienced local organizations in Nepal focused on the migration issue. This is how we work. By partnering with local organizations that already possess extensive knowledge and networks, our technical solutions can connect younger, less experienced workers to a global Nepali diaspora who can help new migrants manage a safer journey.</p>

            <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>
            <p>The Asia Foundation’s e-Citizen Report Card (eCRC) is helping build a smarter and more responsible government in Sri Lanka. By making it easy to collect and analyze anonymous citizen feedback, eCRCs help local authorities measure the quality of government services through the eyes of the citizens who need them most.</p>
            <p>Using the Android-based mobile eCRC app, survey enumerators can collect citizen input on services ranging from waste collection to water to the quality of local libraries. Integration with an online database makes it possible to process these data in real time, and an online dashboard automatically generates simple visuals that convey the findings.</p>
            <p>Within two years of the project's inception, eCRC survey enumerators had visited over 13,000 households in five of Sri Lanka's provinces, and the tool has been welcomed as a crucial addition to local participatory planning and budgeting processes. In fact, while local authorities are free to use the eCRC data as they please, nearly all choose to publish the data - even the most negative findings. This approach is helping lower the cost of high-quality, actionable public perceptions data, and is helping local leaders better understand the needs of citizens and support a broader dialogue with the community on social accountability.</p>

            <strong>Indonesia</strong>
            <p>In February of this year, The Asia Foundation launched <a href="http://incode.design">In.CoDe</a>, or “Innovation and Collaboration for Development,” a project to promote more interactive problem solving between CSOs, universities, government institutions, donors, and the private sector in cities across Indonesia. The initial focus is on addressing challenges affecting urban services, natural resource management, open data issues, and a more accountable parliament.</p>
            <p>Just as platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter first helped communities network and share information in novel ways, entirely new collaboration tools that emphasize crowd-driven, distributed approaches to problem solving are helping In.Code partners address core challenges in novel and unexpected ways. And as the largest community of social media users in the world, activists and change-makers across Asia are poised to leverage these new technologies in ways that will create new and powerful information-sharing, reporting, and advocacy tools. But before even a single project activity is underway or line of code is written, Foundation teams work closely with in-country developer networks, civil society, and government partners to identify the real challenges and concerns of local communities. Defining the problem set is an essential step in the process because technology solutions aren’t really effective unless they are practical, politically viable, and embraced by the communities they aim to serve.  Making that connection first is what the Foundation is all about. </p>
