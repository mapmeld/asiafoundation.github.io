          <h3 class="subtitle">Distributed, decentralized, and massively scalable, social and collaboration tools are making lightweight, low-cost, and typically cloud-based forms of cooperation and work accessible to anyone with a connection to the Internet.   These tools have changed the way The Asia Foundation and our partners work across the region.</h3>

            <strong>In.CoDe Indonesia</strong>
            <p>In February of this year, The Asia Foundation launched <a href="http://incode.design">In.CoDe</a>, or “Innovation and Collaboration for Development,” a project to promote more interactive problem solving between CSOs, universities, government institutions, donors, and the private sector in cities across Indonesia. The initial focus is on addressing challenges affecting urban services, natural resource management, open data issues, and a more accountable parliament.</p>
            <p>Just as platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter first helped communities network and share information in novel ways, entirely new collaboration tools that emphasize crowd-driven, distributed approaches to problem solving are helping In.Code partners address core challenges in novel and unexpected ways. And as the largest community of social media users in the world, activists and change-makers across Asia are poised to leverage these new technologies in ways that will create new and powerful information-sharing, reporting, and advocacy tools. But before even a single project activity is underway or line of code is written, Foundation teams work closely with in-country developer networks, civil society, and government partners to identify the real challenges and concerns of local communities. Defining the problem set is an essential step in the process because technology solutions aren’t really effective unless they are practical, politically viable, and embraced by the communities they aim to serve.  Making that connection first is what the Foundation is all about. </p>
