            <strong>New Delhi, India</strong>
            <p>Emerging from the local women’s movement against street harassment, bullying and stalking, new social collaboration tools like <a href="http://safetipin.org">SafetiPin</a> are helping women work together to assess the relative safety of urban areas in India’s largest cities.  Free to download, SafetiPin is an Android and iOS app that employs location services and an open-source map to allow users to rate a neighborhood or a specific street’s relative safety, while also showing how others have rated that area.</p>
            <p>At the core of the app is the Safety Audit. Users rate the safety of a given area based on key parameters such as the availability of working street lights, the presence of police and other security personnel, the number of men or women on the street, and the overall mood on the street.  The Asia Foundation worked with SafetiPin to provide professionally trained auditors to collect additional safety-related information on communities and cities to augment data submitted by users.</p>
            <p>SafetiPin builds on the premise that community participation and engagement will make India’s cities safer. By leveraging India’s over 300 million mobile phone subscribers, this initiative is transforming the way women connect with one another and obtain safety and security information from within their local communities.</p>
