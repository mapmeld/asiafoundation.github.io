            <strong>Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia</strong>
            <p>Three quarters of a million nomads from across Mongolia now inhabit the “Ger Areas” – a ring of unplanned communities and low-income neighborhoods surrounding the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. In the next decade these areas are expected to grow by an estimated 400,000 additional residents, making the Ger Areas of Ulaanbaatar one of the largest unplanned settlements in Asia.</p>
            <p>A key challenge facing the city government as it struggles to provide water, education, transportation, and other basic urban services to the Ger Areas is a shortage of good data. Current maps of Ulaanbaatar do not represent the existing Ger Areas in much detail. Satellite imagery accessible to the city is often of a low resolution or obscured by cloud cover. Without good geospatial data, planning for the delivery of basic services is very difficult.</p>
            <p>Working with the City of Ulaanbaatar, The Asia Foundation is collecting high-quality imagery and elevation data for the city using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and earth-imaging satellites. These high-resolution images are used to create detailed maps complete with elevation data, and labeled neighborhoods, roads, buildings, landmarks, and other features. And in a bid to make this information open and accessible to all, the maps were shared with <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap (OSM)</a>, a world-wide, community-driven mapping project.</p>
