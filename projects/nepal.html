            <strong>Nepal</strong>
            <p>In Nepal, thousands of young people depart Kathmandu every day on flights to the Gulf Countries and Malaysia, where they make do with limited resources, squalid conditions, and the little knowledge they can glean from Internet and social media sources available on their mobile phones. The Asia Foundation's Safe Migration App, called <i>Shuvayatra</i> ("Safe Travels"), offers access to Nepali networks and multimedia content that can help migrants prepare for the experience in host countries both before and during their time abroad.</p>
            <p>Through the app, users can find relevant, local-language content developed specifically for Nepali migrants, including extensive written materials, a news feed, audio clips and podcasts, and answers to common questions. Migrants can also use the app’s social media features to share information online.</p>
            <p>We’ve put years of research into the needs of Nepali migrant workers and partnered with some of the most experienced local organizations in Nepal focused on the migration issue. This is how we work. By partnering with local organizations that already possess extensive knowledge and networks, our technical solutions can connect younger, less experienced workers to a global Nepali diaspora who can help new migrants manage a safer journey.</p>
