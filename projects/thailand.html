The Asia Foundation is working with local innovators, experts, and policymakers in Thailand to expand the reach of real-time emergency alert systems, and better coordinate preparation and response efforts among government partners.</h3>

            <strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>
            <p>While access to timely, accurate, and official information during natural disasters is a major concern of citizens and governments across Asia, <i>coordination</i> and <i>dissemination</i> of this information has proven challenging. A case in point is the 2011 Bangkok flood: at the height of the disaster, residents and visitors alike were faced with confusing and conflicting announcements from various government ministries. Thais then turned to the Internet and social media to obtain more relevant information and advice. In the aftermath of the flood, the government acknowledged the need for better coordination on DRM data sharing, and disaster preparedness in general.</p>
            <p>The Asia Foundation is working with the National Disaster Warning Center and the Department of Disaster Mitigation and Prevention to expand the use of public APIs to enhance access to government DRM data and better integrate with existing social media platforms popular with Thais. The project will make it possible for disaster response agencies in Thailand to deliver real-time alerts to citizens via social media and better coordinate response efforts with government partners.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Foundation has helped form a DRM Data Working Group to conduct research, initiate pilot projects, and facilitate greater collaboration on DRM data sharing initiatives among key stakeholders.  n emerging community of DRM data partners in Thailand - including Thai entrepreneurs, software developers, civic tech experts, and reform-minded government officials - have joined this initiative, and regular meetings are taking place to facilitate problem-solving and coordination across agencies, and pilot simple data sharing and analysis technologies that have potential to help DRM agencies better protect property and save lives.</p>
